            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-me-description">Hi, my name is Yash Raj Singh and I 
            am sophomore at Dublin High School. I've always been a curious person 
            since I was a child, always wanting to know how things worked, and 
            how I could make them better. Through this I was able to develop an
            interest for the growing field of computing and technology, and 
            learn several programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, and C#. 
            I was driven to learn these programming languages, because they 
            provided me a lot of creative freedom, and allowed me to make a 
            whatever I wanted. Learning C# allowed me to learn to make games, 
            while HTML and CSS allowed for my growth in front end development In
            the future I want to pursue my interests in the field of computer
            science, and would want a career associated with that field. To get 
            a better sense of the field and its emerging technology I constantly
            follow news, participate in competitions, and constantly involve 
            myself in projects to keep improving my knowledge and experience in 
            this fast-changing field.
            <br><br><!-- 2 br tags make a paragraph break -->
            The field of computer science is a very fast changing field, so it 
            requires the enthusiasts to be very adaptive to the new technology.
            Through my daily activities, I believe that I am very suited for
            careers in this field because of my adaptiveness. Through the sports
            that I play, I have learnt to be very tolerant and energetic. The 
            hard projects that I do teach me to be very diligent and innovative
            in my work, and always find new ways to do things. By my own 
            expectations, I strive to be as helpful and versatile to other people
            as I can. Through the hard days of practice for sports, I have learnt
            to become a team player and very supportive of others. These qualities
            will help me in the future with my goal of pursuing a career in the
            field of computer science.
            <br><br>
            From taking hard classes to being on the school swim team, I have 
            learned a lot about myself that I wouldn't have learnt otherwise. 
            Going into sophomore year was a huge jump, and the intensity of the
            classes greatly increased from those during the freshman year. Through
            those hard classes, I was able to learn time-management and 
            organization skills, and learned to complete all my work and have 
            plenty of time to do other things. Being on the school swim team also
            revealed a lot of characteristics about me. I was able to strengthen 
            my mindset to get through the hard sets that was presented to me 
            everyday, and push myself to the maximum to do good in my races. The
            support from my teammates kept me motivated, and allowed for my 
            growth as a team player. I learned the valuable lesson of perseverance
            which taught me to be very strong and tolerant.
