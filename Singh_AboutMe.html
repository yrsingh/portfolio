                        Currently I am exploring full stack development along with my other interests to learn more about the functioning of websites, and hope to master those skills pretty soon. Feel free to explore more on this page to know more about
                        my other interests and hobbies! While I haven't committed to a college yet, I will most likely be attending UC Santa Cruz as a Computer Science major.

                    <p class="about-me-description">
                        I have multiple interests and hobbies in varying 
                        different fields, and also spend a lot of my time 
                        playing sports. Aside from programming, I also 
                        participate in competitive swimming at my school, 
                        and regularly swim outside of school. In addition, I 
                        also play cricket regularly, and am involved in the 
                        commuinties for both sports. I am also very interested
                        in game development, and although not much of a hardcore 
                        gamer, am currently working on a few projects along with 
                        the games I have already made, which you can view at the 
                        <a href="Singh_Projects.html">projects page</a>. I also
                        had a recent interest in cybersecurity, so along with 
                        learning about some defense mechanisms, I also
                        participate in <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/"

                    <p class="about-me-description">
                        During my time in high school, I have gained work experience through a variety of activities 
                        through which I've gained programming knowledge, and industry experience. From taking classes such as AP 
                        Computer Science Applications and Digital Electronics, I've gained knowledge about popular programming languages
                        like java, and the fundamentals of low level computing through the time I spent working with components like 
                        flip flops. The entrepreneurship project was an opportunity to utilize my knowledge to create a new product,
                        and I got very valuable experience about the process of creating a new startup.
                        
                        <br /><br />
                        Through my experience volunteering for the TriValley CoderDojo as a mentor, I got to learn about teaching while I 
                        mentored students in self learning programming. I learnt important communication skills while striving to be as 
                        clear as possible to coders in explaining programming concepts to them. I gained very valuable industry experience
                        through a developer internship, where I was tasked with creating a web portal for teachers to interact with their
                        students. By participating in the USC Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, I gained insight into the process that entrepreneurs 
                        use when creating a new product or launching a new company. All of these experiences have significantly influenced
                        my ability in contributing to the field of Computer Science, and I look forward to going through more these  
                        instructive experiences.

                    <h1 class="display-4">Motivation and Influence</h1>
                    <p class="about-me-description">Through the hard days of practice for sports, I have learnt to become a team player and very supportive of others. By my own expectations, I strive to be as helpful and versatile to other people as I can. Through the challenging classes
                        that I take, I was able to learn time-management and organization skills, and learned to complete all my work and have plenty of time to do other things. The hard projects that I do teach me to be very diligent and innovative in
                        my work, and always find new ways to do things. Being on the school swim team also built a lot of characteristics about me. I was able to strengthen my mindset to get through the hard sets that was presented to me everyday, and
                        push myself to the maximum to do good in my races. The support from my teammates kept me motivated, and allowed for my growth as a team player. I learned the valuable lesson of perseverance which taught me to be very strong and
                        tolerant.These qualities will help me in the future with my goal of pursuing a career in the field of computer science.
