                        Currently I am exploring full stack development along with my other interests to learn more about the functioning of websites, and hope to master those skills pretty soon. Feel free to explore more on this page to know more about
                        my other interests and hobbies!

                    <p class="about-me-description">
                        I have multiple interests and hobbies in varying 
                        different fields, and also spend a lot of my time 
                        playing sports. Aside from programming, I also 
                        participate in competitive swimming at my school, 
                        and regularly swim outside of school. In addition, I 
                        also play cricket regularly, and am involved in the 
                        commuinties for both sports. I am also very interested
                        in game development, and although not much of a hardcore 
                        gamer, am currently working on a few projects along with 
                        the games I have already made, which you can view at the 
                        <a href="Singh_Projects.html">projects page</a>. I also
                        had a recent interest in cybersecurity, so along with 
                        learning about some defense mechanisms, I also
                        participate in <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/"
                        target="blank">Capture the Flag Competitions</a>.

                    <h1 class="display-4">Programming Experience</h1>
                    <p class="about-me-description">I've always been a curious person since I was a child, always wanting to know how things worked, and how I could make them better. Through this I was able to develop an interest for the growing field of computing and technology, and
                        learn several programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, and C#. I was driven to learn these programming languages, because they provided me a lot of creative freedom, and allowed me to make a whatever I wanted. Learning
                        C# allowed me to learn to make games, while HTML and CSS allowed for my growth in front end development. In the future I want to pursue my interests in the field of computer science, and would want a career associated with that
                        field. To get a better sense of the field and its emerging technology I constantly follow news, participate in competitions, and constantly involve myself in projects to keep improving my knowledge and experience in this fast-changing
                        field.The field of computer science is a very fast changing field, so it requires the enthusiasts to be very adaptive to the new technology. Through my daily activities, I believe that I am very suited for careers in this field
                        because of my adaptiveness. I have taken multiple engineering courses, such as AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science Applications. I am currently taking Digital Electronics.</p>

                    <h1 class="display-4">Motivation and Influence</h1>
                    <p class="about-me-description">Through the hard days of practice for sports, I have learnt to become a team player and very supportive of others. By my own expectations, I strive to be as helpful and versatile to other people as I can. Through the challenging classes
                        that I take, I was able to learn time-management and organization skills, and learned to complete all my work and have plenty of time to do other things. The hard projects that I do teach me to be very diligent and innovative in
                        my work, and always find new ways to do things. Being on the school swim team also built a lot of characteristics about me. I was able to strengthen my mindset to get through the hard sets that was presented to me everyday, and
                        push myself to the maximum to do good in my races. The support from my teammates kept me motivated, and allowed for my growth as a team player. I learned the valuable lesson of perseverance which taught me to be very strong and
                        tolerant.These qualities will help me in the future with my goal of pursuing a career in the field of computer science.
