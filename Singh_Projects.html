                    <p>This project involved the use of <a href="scratch.mit.edu">
                    scratch</a>, a visual programming language available for 
                    everyone on the internet.Through this project we solidified 
                    our knowledge on basic programming principles such as variables
                    by implementing them into a project of our choice. With scratch,
                    we were allowed to make a game or a story, of which we chose
                    a game modeled after the popular Space Invaders. Our game consisted
                    of 2 levels, one normal and one boss level, both of which would 
                    contain enemies randomly shooting the player, the only 
                    separation being that the boss ship would move in directions 
                    while the enemies in level 1 would stay unmoving. The boss 
                    would also have a certain amount of health that the player 
                    would need to win the game. Through this project we learned 
                    fundamental programming concepts such as variable types and 
                    operators. In addition, we also learnt organization practices
                    for a project, such as keeping multiple versions of the product, 
                    regularly updating a daily log, and to design a product in 
                    three tiers, with more features and higher workload in each 
                    tiers, which would keep our goals clear and our progress 
                    easily trackable.

                    <p>Using the Unity game engine and the Blender modeling 
                    software, this was one of my first major 3D projects during 
                    the summer because I started from scratch and made all parts
                    of the game myself. The concept of the game was simple, with 
                    a spaceship moving through space while trying to dodge the 
                    asteroids. The execution, however, was not as simple. My 
                    prior knowledge about spawning objects was inefficient and I
                    learned many new methods to make actions efficient, such as 
                    using object pooling instead of instantiating each of the 
                    asteroids to reduce lag in the game. I also solidified my 
                    knowledge about core programming concepts such as variables, 
                    functions, and if statements.</p>

                    <p>Jumper was one of my first 2D projects that I had made 
                    with the Unity game engine. This project served as a test for 
                    my programming skills with the C# language, so many parts of
                    the game were simplified to have it easy for me to focus on 
                    the programming. The game art was premade and was used from 
                    the Unity Asset Store and was by Bayat Games. From this 
                    project I learned about the Unity physics system as I had 
                    used physics to make character control feel realistic. I also 
                    learned a significant amount about AI in this project. 
                    Because I had a type of enemy that would follow the player, 
                    I had to program the AI to take the shortest route to the 
                    player. Overall, in addition to testing my prior knowledge
                    about C# in Unity, I also learned some more advanced scripting
                    concepts that would help me in my future projects.</p>
