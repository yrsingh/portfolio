                        and along with school projects, I have also
                        made a couple of games. I use the Unity game engine and 
                        Blender for the models in my games. I'm really excited
                        to keep making more games and in the future post some of
                        them to the internet for everyone to play.</p>

                    <p>This was the first project of the year, and it introduced 
                        us to core programming concepts such as varibles types.
                        For this project we decided to make a game with a style 
                        similar to Space Invaders, a popular retro shooting game.</p>

                    <p>This game was one of my first major projects that I did 
                        during the summer to demonstrate what I had learned about 
                        Game Development. It was also one of my only 3D games,
                        and along with the game itself, this project was also the 
                        first time I created the art and models for the game as well.</p>

                    <p>Jumper was one of the first games I had done during the 
                    summer that really showed my experience in Game Development
                    and what I had learned so far. This was a 2D Platformer game 
                    with several levels, and was one of my first major projects.</p>
